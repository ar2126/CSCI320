Here's how to build a jar with IntelliJ 10 http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2010/08/quickly-create-jar-artifact/

File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Artifacts -> Click green plus sign -> Jar -> From modules with dependencies...

The above sets the "skeleton" to where the jar will be saved to. To actually build and save it do the following:

Extract to the target Jar

OK

Build | Build Artifact
